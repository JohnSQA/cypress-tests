    Few things to take into account:
    
    1. I wrote a negative test due to the fact that it is a live version of the application and there is hcaptacha there.
    Usually in test environment it is mocked and there a different approach for captcha.

    2. I did see data-qa locators that I assume are used for finding elements on the page, however not everywhere.
    
    3. Since it was 1 single test flow, I didn't implement page object approach, however it would be good to have it when more tests are implemented.
